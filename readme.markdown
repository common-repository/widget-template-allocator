A plugin that allows you to include a template file from your theme on your sidebar.

== Description ==

Sometimes, you need to add something a little more complex than text to you sidebar. I, once, needed to make a tabbed browse for categories and tags for a client and was wearing myself out to find out how to make this a widget. So I figured out I should include a file from the theme in the sidebar. And then Template Allocator was born. You can either give it a title or not, wrap it like the other widgets in the sidebar or not and that's it for now.

**To-do**
* Give the user the hability to specify a custom class to the widget/wrapper.

== Installation ==

1. Upload **fk-widget-template-allocator.php** to the **wp-content/plugins/** directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Drag the *FK Template Allocator* Widget to the Sidebar
1. Configure according to your needs (the file name should **NOT** include the .php extension)
